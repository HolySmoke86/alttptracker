			<h1>Dungeon Tracker</h1>
			<p>The Dungeon Tracker is a helpful tool when playing with Door Shuffle. It can help you remember paths in a dungeon for later, solve switch or key puzzles or remember which item is needed for a path.</p>
			<p>When Door Shuffle is enabled, click on the map icon next to the player sprite to open a new window with the Dungeon Tracker.<br>
			If you have more space, we recommend enlarging this window so that more and longer paths can fit in there without needing to scroll.</p>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>You enter a dungeon.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>If on the overview screen, click on the respective dungeon, usually represented by its vanilla boss. Then, under "Start a new path", click on the entrance you're taking.</td></tr>
			</table><br>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>You come across a branching point and pick one of the available directions that you'll be following next.</td><td rowspan="2"><img class="dtsymbol" src="images/dungeons/arrowright.png"></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>Click on an arrow or quadrant marker that depicts the choice you made in the game. It doesn't matter which symbol you choose as long as you understand what it means when you revisit this room later.</td></tr>
			</table><br>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>You find a big branching point (hub-like room). In addition to marking the next direction, you want to remember the room itself for later.</td><td rowspan="2"><img class="dtsymbol" src="images/dungeons/arrowright.png"></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>Click on "Insert room node" and then on the room you just found. By default, this will append this room to the current path, save it, and start a new path at this node. If you just want to insert the node and keep working on the current path, uncheck "Split path at this node" before clicking on the room.</td></tr>
			</table><br>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>You come across a crystal switch.</td><td rowspan="2"><img class="dtsymbol" src="images/dungeons/crystalswitch.png"></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>Click on the crystal switch symbol. If a specific switch state is needed elsewhere, you might be able to use this switch for that.</td></tr>
			</table><br>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>The path requires a specific crystal switch state (no matter the current state).</td><td rowspan="2"><img class="dtsymbol" src="images/dungeons/orangedown.png"><img class="dtsymbol" src="images/dungeons/bluedown.png"></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>Click on the orange or blue peg symbol, whichever color needs to be down.</td></tr>
			</table><br>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>You reached a dead end (and opened all chests if there were any), or looped back to a previous point and it's not worth remembering this loop for later (for a switch puzzle or routing convenience).</td><td rowspan="2"><img class="dtsymbol" src="images/dungeons/keychest0.png"></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>Click on the opened chest symbol. This will mark this path as finished.</td></tr>
			</table><br>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>You died on the way or for some other reason didn't continue this path and might need to repeat it later.</td><td rowspan="2"><img class="dtsymbol" src="images/dungeons/prize0.png"></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>Click on the question mark symbol. This will mark this path as unfinished.</td></tr>
			</table><br>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>An item you don't currently have is needed.</td><td rowspan="2"><img class="dtsymbol" style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" src="images/items/bow2.png"><img class="dtsymbol" src="images/dungeons/torch.png"></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>Click on the symbol representing that item. Some symbols, like the torch, indicate that one of multiple items is needed.</td></tr>
			</table><br>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>You are (for now) done with the current path (and marked it appropriately) and want to head back to the last branching point and take a different path from there. This usually happens after a dead end, looping back to a previous point or getting blocked by an item requirement.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>Click on "Fork at last direction". This will save the path you just finished traversing for later, and copy everything before the last branch to this new path you're creating now. The next click should be for the direction of the new path you're trying.</td></tr>
			</table><br>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>You are (for now) done with the current path (and marked it appropriately) and want to either leave the dungeon or try a completely different path.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>Click on "Save and close path". This will save the path you just finished traversing for later, and return you to the path list of the current dungeon. If you want to leave the dungeon, click on its name or symbol at the top.</td></tr>
			</table><br>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>You want to continue a previously unfinished path or create a new path based in some way on an existing path.</td></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>Click on the path and then on "Edit path", "Duplicate" or "Fork", depending on what best fits your need. Note that if you do this while editing another path, your changes won't get saved.</td></tr>
			</table><br>
			<table>
				<tr><td><b>Game:</b></td><td>You have fully cleared the current dungeon and know that you won't ever have to come back to it for an item, the boss, the Thieves' Town attic bombable floor or a new connection to a different dungeon exit.</td><td rowspan="2"><img class="dtsymbol" src="images/dungeons/keychest0.png"></tr>
				<tr><td><b>Tracker:</b></td><td>Next to "Your paths", click on "Mark dungeon completed". This will send you back to the overview and there hide any item requirements that were added for this dungeon.</td></tr>
			</table>
			<p>These are just recommendations. For every situation, it's up to you how you want to mark it.<br>
			It will take some practice to get used to tracking while playing without losing time. At the beginning, don't hesitate to pause the game whenever you need more time to track properly.</p>
