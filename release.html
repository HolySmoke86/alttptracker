			Latest Changes:<br><br>
			<b><i>9/26/2019 Build 1.3.007 092619</i></b><br>
			<ul>
				<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
				<li>Finalized rebuilding all of the dungeon logic for all available modes<br>
				As per the previous announcement, there were several changes to the logic structure in regards to small keys in order to handle the new MCS shuffle mode. Because of this, the entire way that chest logic is handled was redesigned. There are chances that some logic issues slipped through testing, and if you discover any, please let Dunka know via Discord @ BigDunka#8354.<br>
				Logic was redesigned to more closely match what is in the randomizer seeding and placement logic. Because of this, areas like Ice Palace, where the tracker would previously show available via bomb jump, that has since been removed and the bomb jump is no longer in logic. Other areas, like Turtle Rock with small key shuffle, were redesigned to allow for max potential items for keys by logic, which means it will not count skipping the vanilla big key location with only 3 small keys, making the boss not killable.<br>
				Other areas went outside of the logic, with regards to availability of killing bosses. If a boss is killable, but the dungeon is not fully clearable, it will show that the boss can be defeated, even if the logic states that it shouldn't be. Other areas that were adjusted with for getting items "smartly" and showing possibilities. PoD is an example, with being able to full clear all items and the boss with just five small keys, as long as you use the hammer and bow to not open the front door. These logically are marked as possible on the map, but will not show fully available without all six keys.<br>
				Long story short: Please use the map tracker with the understanding that it is based off the logic and you can use your knowledge of the game to bypass this logic, the same way you could use a sequence break to get items you should not.<br>
				<u>Misc Changes</u><br>
				<li>Added right click functionality for small keys and chests</li><br>
				<li>Updated the ALTTPR 2019 Tournament presets to the newly defined flags</li><br>

			<b><i>9/18/2019 Build 1.3.004 091819</i></b><br>
			<ul>
				<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
				<li>Continued work on IP, TR, and GT logic, and a more simplified way to track items in all dungeons</li><br>
				<u>Mode Changes</u><br>
				<li>Enabled Enemy Shuffle, which is important to complete some dungeons (ie: Possibly completing Eastern Palace without the bow without having to fight the red Eyegores)</li><br>
				<li>Enabled Item Placement, which for this tracker, is only important for dark rooms with torches being in logic with Fire Rod (Not all logic has been entered and tested)</li><br>
				<u>Misc Changes</u><br>
				<li>Adjusted the styles to make chests larger when small and big keys are not being tracked, to eliminate un-used space</li><br>
				<li>Added preset option for ALTTPR 2019 Tournament qualifiers</li><br>
			</ul>			
			<b><i>9/17/2019 Build 1.3.003 091719</i></b><br>
			<ul>
				<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
				<li>Fixed issue where DW dungeons were showing accessible without DW access</li><br>
				<u>Mode Changes</u><br>

			</ul>
			<b><i>9/16/2019 Build 1.3.002 091619a</i></b><br>
			<ul>
				<u>Logic Changes</u><br>
				<li>Fixed a few boss requirements to add in more obscure items that can kill bosses in logic</li><br>
				<u>Mode Changes</u><br>
				<li>Combined modes for Boss and Enemy Shuffle to be either on or off, as logic does not change based off those flags (Any flags that can be condensed is good!)</li><br>
				<li>Enabled Open Tower and Ganon Vulnerable flags. The user will be given an icon in the top left hand corner to click on to set the known requirements if the requirements are random.</li><br>
			</ul>
			<b><i>9/16/2019 Build 1.3.001 091619</i></b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>First major release for v31!<br>
				<li>Complete overhaul of launcher to show all available flags, and several that will be released in the future, including entrance!<br>
				<li>Updated all sub-page interfaces and stylesheets<br>
				<li>Overhaul of logic to match new v31 options<br>
				NOTICE: There will be several incremental updates once v31 is formally released. We are basing the logic off what limited information has been released to this point. Please be sure to report any issues when you find them and we will make an updated list on the Known Issues page.<br>
				<li>Removed "known easy sequence breaks" to line up the general logic, but continue to allow "common sense" sequence breaks<br>
				To expand on this, the original tracker always had Ice Palace built in with a possible sequence break with the bomb jump. That has since been removed and the notation in the comments also removed. If you do not have the Hookshot or Somaria, Ice Palace will show as not completable. This is because there are going to be new flags in the logic to allow for certain glitches to be auto-populated and the previous logic would override that.<br>
				Other common sense logic, however, has not been removed. For example, in Full Shuffle, Desert Palace is not completable by logic without both the big key and the small key, to prevent a potential small key lock. However, if you have the big key and not the small key, the tracker will show that the dungeon boss is indeed killable. This is to allow for ease of recognition of clearable dungeons while in go mode.<br>
				<li>Added a new purple color coded map tracker function for "Dark Room Possible". The current color codes are now as follows:<br>
				Red = Unavailable<br>
				Green = Available<br>
				Yellow = Possible<br>
				Blue = Dark Room Available<br>
				Purple = Dark Room Possible<br>
				<li>Right clicking on crystal/pendant icons will go backwards, making for faster crystal selection<br>
				<li>This release is assuming Basic Item Placement, which means required items are using the v30 logic (Laser Bridge for example still requires a safety). Advanced logic will be added in a future release.<br>
				<li>Entrance Shuffle, Enemy Shuffle, Glitches, Item Placement, Open Tower, Ganon Vulnerable, and Spoiler Log settings are currently disabled, pending more development and validation</li><br>
			</ul>
